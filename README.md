# Basic Full Text Search for SilverBullet
Previously a built-in plug for SilverBullet, now installable separately for those who don’t want to use Silversearch. 

Generally it is recommended you use [Silversearch](https://github.com/MrMugame/silversearch) instead. It’s a bit heavier weight, but produces _significantly_ better results.

## Install
Using `Library: Install` enter as URI: `https://github.com/silverbulletmd/basic-search/blob/main/PLUG.md`

## Build
To build this plug, make sure you have [Deno installed](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/). Then, build the plug with:

```shell
deno task build
```
