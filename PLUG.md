# Basic Full Text Search
Formerly a built-in plug for SilverBullet, now installable separately for those who don’t want to (for whatever reason) use the far superior [Silversearch](https://github.com/MrMugame/silversearch) instead. Seriously, use Silversearch instead of this.

No? Alright then.

## Initial index
Perform a `Space: Reindex` after installing this plug.

## Commands
* `Search Space` (`Cmd-Shift-f`/`Ctrl-Shift-f`): performs a full text search across your space.
